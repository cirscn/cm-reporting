          "This Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (Template) is a free, standardized reporting template created by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). The Template facilitates the transfer of information through the supply chain regarding mineral country of origin and smelters and refiners being utilized and supports compliance to legislation*. The template also facilitates the identification of new smelters and refiners to potentially undergo an audit via the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process**.\n\nThe CMRT was designed for downstream companies to disclose information about their supply chains up to but not including the smelter.  If you are a 3TG smelter or refiner, in accordance with the RMAP protocols, we recommend you enter your own name in the smelter list tab.\n\nWhen filling out the form, none of the cell entries should start will \"=\" or \"#.\"",
          "* In 2010, the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was passed concerning “conflict minerals” originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or adjoining countries. The SEC published final rules associated with the disclosure of the source of conflict minerals by U.S. publicly traded companies (see the rules at http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2012/34-67716.pdf). The rules reference the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas, (http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/mne/GuidanceEdition2.pdf), which guides suppliers to establish policies, due diligence frameworks and management systems.\nIn 2017, Regulation (EU) 2017/821 of the European Parliament and of the European Council of 17 May 2017 was passed concerning supply chain due diligence obligations for Union importers of tin, tantalum and tungsten, their ores, and gold originating from conflict-affected and high-risk areas (see regulation at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L:2017:130:FULL&from=EN)\n** See information on the Responsible Minerals Initiative (www.responsiblemineralsinitiative.org).",

The questions are designed to collect information about the use of 3TG in the company’s product(s) to allow for the determination of regulatory applicability. Responses to these questions shall represent the ‘Declaration Scope’ selected in the company information section.The responses to the questions in this section can be used to determine applicability and completeness of 3TG reporting.",

          "1. This is the first of two questions for which the response is used to determine whether the 3TG is within the scope of conflict minerals reporting requirements.  This question relies upon the guidance provided by the SEC in the final rules regarding the determination if a 3TG is “necessary to the functionality or production” of a product.   The SEC guidance is based upon the presumption that a company in the supply chain for a product would not intentionally add a 3TG to that product or any of a product’s sub-components if that 3TG was not necessary to the product’s generally expected function, use, or purpose.  Similarly, the guidance presumes that a 3TG would not be necessary to the production of a product unless it was intentionally included in the production process of that product. The response to this question serves to exclude any trace-level contaminants or naturally-occurring by-products such as tin in steel.  This question shall  be answered for each 3TG.\n\nThis question asks if any conflict minerals are used as raw material, component or additive in a product that you manufacture or contract to manufacture (including raw material and components). Impurities from raw materials, components, additives, abrasives, and cutting tools are outside the scope of the survey.\n\nThis question shall be answered for each 3TG. Valid responses to this question are either \"yes\" or \"no\". This question is mandatory.",
          "Some companies may require substantiation for a \"No\" answer that should be entered into the Comment Field.",
          "2. This question shall be answered for each 3TG for each the answer to question 1 is \"yes.\" This is the second of two questions for which the response is used to determine whether the 3TG is within the scope of conflict minerals reporting requirements as described in the SECs final rules regarding the determination if a 3TG is necessary to the functionality or production of a product.  This question is dependent upon the question and response to Question 1.  This question is intended to identify 3TGs which are intentionally added or included in the manufacturing process of a product where some amount of the 3TG remains in the finished product.  This includes 3TGs which may not have been intended to become part of the final product and may not be necessary to the functionality of the product but are only present as residuals of the manufacturing process.  In many cases, the manufacturer may have attempted to remove or facilitate consumption of the 3TG during the manufacturing process, however, some amount of the 3TG remains.  Should the 3TG, which is added or included during the manufacturing process, be completely removed such that none of the 3TG remains upon the completion of that process, the response to this question would be no.\n\nThis question shall be answered for each 3TG. Valid answers to this question are either \"yes\" or \"no\". This question is mandatory.",
          "3. This is a declaration that any portion of the 3TGs contained in a product or multiple products originates from the DRC or an adjoining country (covered countries). The answer to this question should be \"yes\" if any smelter in the supply chain sources from the covered countries, even if those smelters are on the RMI conformant smelter and refiner list.  For more information, see RMI's due diligence guidance on conflict minerals here: http://www.responsiblemineralsinitiative.org/training-and-resources/publications-and-guidance/.\n\nThe answer to this question shall be \"yes\", \"no\", or \"unknown\".

          "5. This is a declaration that identifies whether 3TGs contained in the product(s) necessary to the functionality of that product(s) originate from recycled or scrap sources. \n\nThe answer to this question shall be \"yes\", \"no\", or \"unknown\". This question is mandatory for a specific metal if the response to Question 1 and 2 is “Yes” for that metal. \n\nA \"Yes\" answer means that 100% of the 3TG comes from recycled or scrap sources.  A \"No\" answer means that some of the 3TG does not come from recycled or scrap sources.

[D]etermining whether a conflict mineral is considered ‘‘necessary’’ to a product should not depend on whether the conflict mineral is added directly to the product by the issuer or whether it is added to a component of the product that the issuer receives from a third party. Instead, the issuer should ‘report on the totality of the product and work with suppliers to comply with the requirements.’ Therefore, in determining whether a conflict mineral is ‘‘necessary’’ to a product, an issuer must consider any conflict mineral contained in its product, even if that conflict mineral is only in the product because it was included as part of a component of the product that was manufactured originally by a third party.”\n*(56296 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 177 / Wednesday, September 12, 2012 / Rules and Regulations)"

The Template facilitates the transfer of information through the supply chain regarding mineral country of origin and smelters and refiners being utilized and supports compliance to legislation*. The template also facilitates the identification of new smelters and refiners to potentially undergo an audit via the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process**.\n\nThe AMRT was designed for downstream companies to disclose information about their supply chains up to but not including the smelter.  If you are a smelter, refiner, or processor, in accordance with the RMAP protocols, we recommend you enter your own name in the smelter list tab.\n\nWhen filling out the form, none of the cell entries should start will \"=\" or \"#.\"",

This is true regardless of who intentionally added the conflict mineral to the product so long as it is contained in the product. [D]etermining whether a conflict mineral is considered ‘‘necessary’’ to a product should not depend on whether the conflict mineral is added directly to the product by the issuer or whether it is added to a component of the product that the issuer receives from a third party. Instead, the issuer should ‘report on the totality of the product and work with suppliers to comply with the requirements.’ Therefore, in determining whether a conflict mineral is ‘‘necessary’’ to a product, an issuer must consider any conflict mineral contained in its product, even if that conflict mineral is only in the product because it was included as part of a component of the product that was manufactured originally by a third party.”\n*(56296 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 177 / Wednesday, September 12, 2012 / Rules and Regulations)"
